## Test result

Here's my IELTS result which took me one month:

All of my materials related to IELTS are pushed to the GitHub repo:

I want to share some general steps of preparations in four sections:

## Listening

### Test Books

The most important one is the **IELTS Cambridge Test Books**.

Please spend around **3 - 5 days** to get familiar with **different kinds** of questions in the Listening Part.

Then, you need to remember the most difficult kind(s).

For me, that is the *Matching and Map* questions.

It's **not enough** to finish tests one by one and check the answers. (**Quality** is better than Quantity)

The best method should have four steps:

1. Check the answer **without analyzing**.

2. **Ignore** the *misspelled* words caused by careless and **write down** the *unknown* words.

3. Pick out the specific Section which you *can't understand* the conversation or make *too many mistakes*, and **listen to that again with x1.5 speed** until one/two mistakes left. I recommend two softwares ([PotPlayer Win)](https://potplayer.daum.net/) or [VLC (all platforms)](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)) for this function.

4. Summarize the reasons of each error to the **Hit List**.

This is the example of Hit List:


| Test  | No.  | Reason                      |
| ----- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| 9.1.1 | 2    | Location name               |
|       | 6    | wrong number: 11 o'clock    |
| 9.1.2 | 16   | wrong words: backs --> bags |
| 9.1.3 | 28   | Tense                       |

> Test: the exact name of test. "9.1.1" means Cambridge IELTS 9, Test 1, Section 1
>
> No.: the No. of the question
>
> Reason

### Podcasts

I usually listened to the [**BBC 6 minute English**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english) podcast before sleep and reviewed the **words** (you can check that in the audio *transcript*, if you're not sure about the word) and useful **topics** next morning.

For example, [The joy of free diving](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english/ep-191128) talks about an interesting water sport named "free diving".

*Useful words*: "spooky", "intimidating", "be deprived of sensations"

*Useful topic*: Water sport which is the Speaking topic in IELTS. (IELTS has constant Speaking Topics and Questions. I will explain this in detail in the Speaking Section.)

You can **benefit a lot** from the BBC 6 minute English podcast besides words and topic:

1. British English pronunciation
2. Natural English
3. Fast speaking speed (sometimes)

**Don't** pay too much attention to Podcast !!!

### Videos

I only recommend [**TED talks**](https://www.ted.com/talks) ... because I believe most examinees don't have enough time for TV Series or movies.

The filter is the good tool to find the suitable talk to IELTS specially.

For example, I choose Language(English), Duration (0 - 6 minutes) and Topic (environment):

![Ted_filter](/images/sci-tech/2019-12/ted_filter.png)

**Don't** pay too much attention to Videos !!!

## Reading

The ZhiHu live lecture named [ÈõÖÊÄùÈòÖËØª9ÂàÜÂ§áËÄÉÊåáÂçó](https://www.zhihu.com/lives/848533834134880256) (Ôø•9.9) summarizes all useful skills and tips for IELTS Reading.

The most beneficial technique is practicing **specific kind** of Reading question **at once**. After 1 week, you will find you're not afraid of IELTS reading any more.

Next step is to **mock** Reading Test in **50 mins** instead of 1 h.

## Writing

I got low band (5.5) in this section and suppose that it's caused by Task 2.

I spent the least time on preparing Writing ... Now, I reap what I sow :(

In my opinion, you need to spend at least one month on Writing.

### Task 1

Following the instructions of [**Simon**](https://ielts-simon.com/) will lead you to the door of **band 8 - 9**.

After watching his tutorials about Task 1 on YouTube or other media, you must **practice** each type in his eBook by yourself and **compare** with the answers.

### Task 2

As same as Task 2, Simon illustrates all steps you need to finish the short essay.

The "[Ideas for IELTS topics](https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-ebook.html)" eBook written by Simon would help you get band higher than 7.

## Speaking

I just spent ~ 15 days to prepare for the Speaking part.

### Skills

I learned a lot from [**Mark Teacher**](https://markteacher.com/) who listened to my records and helped me correct many mistakes, like *pronunciation, words and tense*. You can check some example tutorials on his YouTube channel: [IELTS Speaking with Mark Teacher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoiUwUEOeoyNvFO7yJlg1XQ/featured).

Although local accent won't affect your score, you need to make sure the *basic pronunciation* right. Old [**BBC Pronunciation tips**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/pron/) website recommended by Mark could fix these problems.

### Topics

When you get enough skills for IELTS Speaking, it's time to prepare these Topics on [Chris Green's website](http://ielts-yasi.englishlab.net) in which all recent topics are saved, especially for **Part2**.

Please write down **keywords** instead of exactly every sentence. This will let you have a better *plan and fluency* when you have test.

Remember four band descriptors in your mind when you're practicing:

1. Fluency and coherence
2. Lexical resource
3. Grammatical range and accuracy
4. Pronunciation

**Task Achievement**, which is the descriptor in Writing, **isn't important** in the Speaking Part.

**Feel free** to talk about the Part 2 topic :) Don't care about the listed points.
