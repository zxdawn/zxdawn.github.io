## Website

All materials are listed on the website of the Austrian Visa Application Centre in China: [English](http://www.austriavisa-china.com/index.html) and [Chinese](http://www.austriavisa-china.com/chinese/index.html) version.

We need to apply for **Business visit (商务访问)** of Type C.

Please check them in detail by yourself, especially the **DOCUMENTS REQUIRED (所需材料)** part.

## Passport

> Issued within the previous 10 years. Minimum two blank visa pages. Valid for at least 3 months beyond the validity of your visa request. PP must be signed by its owner. Copy of data page; copies of pages showing visas and/or exit/entry stamps. Submission of previous passport(s) is appreciated.

If your passport begins with `EF`, you just need **two** copies of the first page (data page) and pages showing visas and/or exit/entry stamps. Otherwise, the last page should be copied too.

## Photographs

> Colour, 35x45mm, white background, undamaged, no headpiece

**Two** photos must be taken by a professional photographer or the photographer of the local Visa Application Center (CNY 40). The staff will glue them for you.

## HUKOU and ID Card

> Copies of the whole hukou including the holder’s pages and all member information pages

**Two** copies of ID card and **One** copy of HUKOU.

## Medical Insurance

> Minimum coverage of EUR 30.000 for medical costs and repatriation. Valid in all Schengen Countries during the validity of the visa requested. 

Please make sure the medical costs should be **more than EUR 30.000**.

I chose the standard plan (标准计划: 05-04-2019 ~ 15-04-2019: CNY 122) of Schengen travel insurance (申根旅行保险) *Allianz SE (安联保险)*. If you need the invoice, please ask for the online service and she/he will give you an email address.

The duration must be **1-2 days** before and after the whole trip.

**One colorful** printing of data page (For *Allianz SE*, the first two pages are enough).

## Letter of Invitation

**One** copy of *EGU2019-letter-of-invitation.pdf*. Apply for a letter of invitation [here](https://egu2019.eu/about_and_support/letter_of_invitation.html).

## Dispatching Letter

> Purpose, duration and detailed program of the visit; stamped and signed by an authorized signatory
>
> Position, salary, years of employment of applicant and confirmation of position after return.
>
> Name, position and contact of the person responsible for the assumption of all travel expenses.

Dispatching letter is **signed** by *university or school*. Please contact the principal of your university or school.

For me, I handed in the letter of my school.

## Business license of Chinese Enterprise

**One stamped** copy of university's certificate of legal person of institution (事业单位法人证复印件) in Chinese. The staff will translate it for you (CNY 75).

## Proof of Solvency of Application

Because my supervisor will cover all fees by his project, I declared these in the dispatching letter and add one *Funding Certificate*.

**Update: Bank Statements are necessary: Stamped 3 months' statements (Balance > 10,000)**

## Study Certificate

**One stamped** Study Certificate in English.

##  Application Form

It's better to edit it by a software like *Adobe Acrobat* or *[icecream pdf editor](https://icecreamapps.com/PDF-Editor/) (free).*

- **Date and Signature** should be left empty;
- All information should be written in **English**;
- Format of date: **dd-mm-yyyy**;

Total payable CNY 833:
