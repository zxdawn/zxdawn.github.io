## Experience

I have used much software for writing my papers from the undergraduate period.

Here's the timeline: (I suppose I won't change any more ...)

**Reference manager **: EndNote --> Mendeley --> Citavi --> Zotero

**Writing**: Word --> Markdown (Typora+Notion) + LaTeX (Sublime Text)

This post focuses on the reference manager called **[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)**

## Zotero

> Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help youcollect, organize, cite, and share research.
>
> Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux

*Free, All platforms, and high Flexibility* are the main reason why I choose Zotero.

As I don't wanna compare different software here, you can try anyone you like.

Actually I bought Citavi more than one year ago, it's only available for Windows until the Web version is released last year.

I was addicted to so many functions of Citavi, but I just used the annotation, organization and exportation.

Finally, I switched to Zotero which is clean and small.

### Importation

Because I used Citavi for a long time, I need to import all references into Zotero.

[The Zotero official website](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/import-from-citavi) gives the methods for importing references from popular managers like EndNote, Mendeley, and Citavi.

Don't be afraid. That's easy and quick ;)

### Settings, Sync and Plugins

I always use **[MEGA](https://mega.nz/)** to sync my files across multiple devices and found this [awesome tutorial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325828616_Tutorial_The_Best_Reference_Manager_Setup_Zotero_ZotFile_Cloud_Storage?channel=doi&linkId=5c05d0b2a6fdcc315f9adbae&showFulltext=true) on ResearchGate.

You can follow that to set up your own Zotero.

I list the benefits of Zetero here:

- Basic organization of references

- Extraction of references from PDFs and Webs

- Accurate DOI and citation number

- Auto renaming PDFs with own routes

- Independent sync method:

  â€‹	Official sync of references and personal sync of PDFs

- Extraction of Notes

- Analysis of references

- Auto generation of bibliographies

## Overview

You can check the Official Documentation for details.

The picture below is the interface of my Zotero.

**Enjoy your Zotero !!!**
