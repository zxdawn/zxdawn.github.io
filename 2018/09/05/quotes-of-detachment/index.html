H: Most of the teachers here, at one point &mldr; they believed &mldr; that they could make a difference. You know, I know how important it is to have guidance and to have someone help understand the complexities of the world that we live in. I didn&rsquo;t really have that growing up.

You gotta undertand that unfortunately most people lack self-awareness. You should really keep that in mind as you had another transient of second period. You will meet them again at every age.</p><hr></li><li><p>Henry: Whatever is on my mind, I say there&rsquo;s a feeling. I&rsquo;m truthful to myself. I&rsquo;m young, and I&rsquo;m old. I&rsquo;ve been bought and I&rsquo;ve been sold so many times. I&rsquo;m hard to face. I am gone. I&rsquo;m just like you.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: You know it&rsquo;s funny I spend a lot of time trying to not have to deal, to not really commit. I&rsquo;m a substitute teacher. There&rsquo;s no responsibility to teach. The responsibility is to maintain order, make sure nobody kills anybody in your classroom. And then they get to the next period.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: Are you doin&rsquo; any writing, grandpa?</p></li><li><p>G: No, my life isn&rsquo;t worth memories.

Anyone?</p></li><li><p>M: Having two opposing beliefs at once. Believing that both are true.</p></li><li><p>H: To deliberately believe in lies while knowing they&rsquo;re false. Examples of this in everyday life: Oh, I, need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin. Famous. Fashionable. Our young men, today, are being told that women are whores; Bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, ashamed. This is a marketing holocaust. 24 hours a day, for the rest of our lives, the power that be are hard at work dumbing us to death. So, to defend ourselves and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, we must learn to read to stimulate our own imagination; To cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief system. We all need these skills to defend, to preserve our own minds.</p><hr></li><li><p>This faculty has spent their lives on the boards, and now you tell us that our careers are about re-sale value.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: We all have problems, we all have things that we&rsquo;re dealing with. And we all &mldr; take them home with us at night, take them to work with us in the morning. I think that helplessness, that realization, that foreboding of being a drift in the sea, with on &mldr; no bowie, no safety, when you thought you&rsquo;d be the one. Throwing the bowie.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: Haven&rsquo;t you ever had enough. Haven&rsquo;t you ever just wanted to tell someone to fuck off. I mean the whole &mldr; the whole thing is fucked. Whole thing is fuck, is it not?</p><hr></li><li><p>Grace: Oh god, you&rsquo;re a shallow disgusting creature. You want to know the truth?</p><p>One, you&rsquo;re not gonna bi in a band or an Model Missy, because you have no ambition. With no skills, you will be competing with the 80% of the U.S. workforce for a minimum wage job which you&rsquo;ll work at for the rest of your life til you&rsquo;re replaced by a computer.</p><p>Two, The only talent you&rsquo;ll ever have is getting men to fuck you. You life will basically become a carnival of pain. Now, when you can&rsquo;t stand it not one more day, not one more hour, it will get worse, much worse! Every day I come into this office and listen to you kids shit all over yourselves! It&rsquo;s so easy to be careless. It takes courage and courage to take care. Not that you have any of those qualities.</p></li><li><p>I will tell you my opinion, the worst thing about this job is that nobody says thank you. I&rsquo;m here to say thank you.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: Daddy, you can feel free to leave, whenever you&rsquo;re ready.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: The park is now empty and bare, with an abandoned chain. The jungle gym, the slide and swing have rusted together. They&rsquo;re all so terribly alone now. Where did all the children go? Didn&rsquo;t they know that the park needed them? The child&rsquo;s intelligent heart can fathom the depth for many dark places. I can&rsquo;t fathom the delicate moment of its own detachment.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: We&rsquo;re all the same. We all feel pain. We all have chaos in our lives. Life is very, very confusing, I know. I don&rsquo;t have the answers, but I know if you write it out, it&rsquo;ll all be okay.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: I wish things were different. I tried, you know &mldr; Fuck &mldr; The things is &mldr; We all &mldr; We all have problems. We all have things that we&rsquo;re dealing with. Some days were better than others. Some days were not so great. Somedays we have limited space for others. These kids need something else. They don&rsquo;t need me.</p><hr></li><li><p>It may sound broke but I&rsquo;ve always felt that the school had a spirit. It&rsquo;s not just a bunch of old buildings, but they&rsquo;re alive.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: I actually felt quite at home. No parents. I thought how appropriate. It was like&mldr; a moment of insight&mldr; the reality of the fucking problem in the first place. Some of us believe that we can make a difference. And then sometimes we wake up and we realize we&rsquo;ve failed.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: We all need something to distract us from the complexity and reality. More or less to think about where that came from? No one wants to think about the struggle that it takes to become somebody to get out of the sea of pain that we all have to get out of.</p><hr></li><li><p>M: They said that suicide is a permanent solution to the temporary problem. I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: We have such a responsibility to guide our young so that they don&rsquo;t end up falling apart, falling by the way side, becoming insignificant.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: I realized something today. I&rsquo;m a non-person, Sarah. You shouldn&rsquo;t be here. I&rsquo;m not here. You may see me, but I&rsquo;m hollow.</p></li><li><p>H: Failing. We&rsquo;re failing. Failed in a sense that we have let everyone down, including ourselves.</p><hr></li><li><p>H: When you&rsquo;re walking down the hallway, or in your classroom, how many of you have ever felt the weight pressing down on you? I have. Everyone? Well, Poe wrote about these things over 100 years ago. So, as we read, we can see that &ldquo;the House of Usher&rdquo; is not merely an old decrapped castle under its repair. It&rsquo;s also a state of being.</p><p>&ldquo;DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself, as the shades of evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I looked upon the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak walls, upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul. There was an iciness,&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div><div class=row><div class=col-md-8><div class=mb-5><div class="li-x div-x post-meta"><li class=pr-0><a href=https://zxdawn.github.io/tags/><i class="fas fa-tags"></i></a></li><div class=tags-sm><li><a href=https://zxdawn.github.io/tags/life role=button>Life</a></li></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row pt-3"><div class=col-md-6><a href=https://zxdawn.github.io/2018/09/03/%E5%B0%8F%E8%AE%B0%E4%B8%89%E5%88%99/ class=post-meta>Previous<div class="pt-2 pb-5 d-flex"><i class="fas fa-angle-left text-grey font-weight-bold mr-2 active-color"></i>
