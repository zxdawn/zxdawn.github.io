body: "Dear Xin,\r\n\r\nThank you for this wonderful tutorial. I just have one question.\r\n\r\nWhere are you downloading these data from? ERA5 data are on the CISL RDA (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds630.0/), but the data are not in discrete time slices as required by ungrib.exe. I am planning to downscale ERA5 for a 40-year period, so I am trying to find grb files that are date-time specific...\r\n\r\nIt looks like the above scripts nicely subset the data and pull relevant variables into new grb files?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Stefan Rahimi, UCLA"
