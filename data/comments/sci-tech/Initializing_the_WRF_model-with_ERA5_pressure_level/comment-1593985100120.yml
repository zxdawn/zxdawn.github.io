body: "Would it be beneficial to add 'geopotential' to the GetERA5-sl.py part of the code? That would download GRIB code=129, level code=1 (surface), which WRF uses to construct SOILGEO and SOILHGT. [url]https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=82870405#ERA5:datadocumentation-Table1[/url] says it's available. \r\n\r\nBack when I first stated using ERA-Interim for WRF I constructed an invariant SOILGEO file, so why not for ERA5?"
