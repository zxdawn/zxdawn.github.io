body: "Hi Xin, \r\nI came across your very informative blog recently. I wanted to know whether we can use ERA-Interim Subsets to force WRF. When I tried forcing the subset from rda ucar website. metgrid.exe throws \"Gaussian Latittude Computation Error\". Other blogs are suggesting to download global data which is humongous and takes a lot of time. I want simulations only on my study region. Can you suggest any alternative or detailed tutorial to use ERA-INterim subsets with WRF??"
