body: "Hi Xin,\r\n\r\nSorry to bother you again.\r\nThanks very much for your wonderful tutorial to enable me to run WRF successfully with ERA5 reanalysis data. But error happened when I used the forecast field data as the boundary forcing condition. Error is as follows when running the ungrib.exe,\r\n\r\n\"Unknown Data Representation Type, ksec2(4)=           50 \"\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nHappy new year!\r\nPeng"
