body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nNote that the step of `calc_ecmwf_p.exe` is necessary for model level data, not pressure data.\r\n\r\nIf you're using model level data, you need to create `ecmwf_coeffs` by yourself. Please check my [another tutorial](https://dreambooker.site/2018/04/20/Initializing-the-WRF-model-with-ERA5/).\r\n\r\nXin"
