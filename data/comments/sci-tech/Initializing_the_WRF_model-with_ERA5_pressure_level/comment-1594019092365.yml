body: "Dear Xin,\r\n\r\nWhen i do ungrib.exe, I can ungrib pressure-level ERA5 data, but I can not ungrib surface ERA5 data. It was said that 'was expecting a Grib1 file , but this is a Grib2 file. It is possible this is because your GRIBFILE.XXX files are not all of the same type. '\r\n\r\nI will appreciate your any suggestions.\r\n\r\nDu"
