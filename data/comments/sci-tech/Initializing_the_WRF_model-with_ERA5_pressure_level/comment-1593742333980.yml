body: "Hi Xin, thanks for your tutorial,  and I have some questions.\r\nI'm ungribbing ERA-Interim data(pressure level), can I use SH, 2m T and 2m dewpoint T to calculate RH by adding SPECHUMD to the Vtable.ECMWF?\r\nI noticed this RH data are different from ungribbing it directly with ERA-Interim RH data in met files, what could be the problem?\r\n\r\nChi"
