      I've successfully used these instructions when the download was from the ECMWF API, but now that the data is on Copernicus, the Copernicus API will only give me the model-level data in GRIB2 format.\n\n
      This causes an error when running ungrib, as the Vtable you've given is only for GRIB1 format.\n\n
      Anyone else having this issue? Is it an easy modification for the Vtable?"
