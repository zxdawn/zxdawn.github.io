body: "Hi, thanks for this writeup!\n\n
      Can you please elaborate why you need to create PSFC in the last step?\n\n
      My met_em files already contain a PSFC field (I download it as field\"134\" or \"sp\" from ECMWF).\n\n
      Interestingly, the original PSFC values I download are significantly different from what I get by re-creating PSFC from LOGSFP as you do it.\n\n
      Can you shed some light on this issue? I' really appreciate!"
