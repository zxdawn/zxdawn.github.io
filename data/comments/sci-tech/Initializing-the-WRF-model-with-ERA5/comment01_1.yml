      1. Because surf_press_name is `PSFC` in `mo_wrfchem_lib.f90` file which is needed by MOZART mechanism. If you just use WRF, you don't have to convert it.\n\n
      2. For the problem of difference, it looks strange!\n\n
      Could you send the figure (which compare both variables) or the file just containing these variable (you can use ncks to extract it)?\n\n
      My email address: xinzhang1215@gmail.com."
