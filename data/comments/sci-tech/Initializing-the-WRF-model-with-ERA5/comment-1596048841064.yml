  Hi Xin, thank you very much for your explanation. Everything was perfect up to
  ungrib with ERA5 surface and model levels. My ungrib was generating PFILES but
  was never able to generate all the corresponding FILES. Some strange error
  messages appeared in the log file ("unknown out_format, ifv = 1133007385" or
  "Unrecognized map%igrid: 39936 in RRPR 2" or "Read error 1 in PARSE_TABLE"). I
  then assumed a memory issue as the number of generated FILES or PFILES was not
  always the same. I increased node memory up to 125GB ! Then I obtained
  successful completion. Every FILE or PFILE has around 100MB size so the
  situation does not seem to be a logical one. I am using 137 levels 0.25 deg x
  0.25 deg in an area of 35 deg x 70 deg for 32 times every hour. My command is
  srun -N1 -n8 --mpi=pmi2 --mem=125G /home/peter/Build_WRF/WPS-4.2/ungrib.exe 
  Do you have a common sense explanation for the need of 125 GB?
