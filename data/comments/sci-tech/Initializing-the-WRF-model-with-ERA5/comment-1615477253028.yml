body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nAfter running WPS (with no errors), I'm running real.exe and encounter this error:\r\n \r\n-------------- FATAL CALLED ---------------\r\nFATAL CALLED FROM FILE: <stdin> LINE: 2977\r\ngrid%tsk unreasonable\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n \r\nI'm using WRF/WPS v4.1.3. I've looked into the SKINTEMP variable and did not find any unreasonable values associated with it. In my metgrid output files, I appear to not have a TSK variable at all. I've tried several fixes such as editing the METGRID.TBL file to change how to fill missing values, etc. How should I go about solving this?"
