body: "just talked to ECMWF Service Desk, here's their answer:\n\n
      It is more complex than doing `exp(lnsp) -> sp`. As a general rule, you should use lnsp if you work with the model level data. Otherwise you should get surface pressure directly from surface level.\n\n
      So it seems you did the correct thing."
